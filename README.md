ðŸ©º Overview
This repository implements a deep learning-based solution for detecting tuberculosis (TB) in chest X-ray images using MobileNetV2 and PyTorch. MobileNetV2, a lightweight and efficient convolutional neural network, is well-suited for medical image analysis tasks, making it an ideal choice for this project.

The model is trained to classify X-ray images as either:

Tuberculosis Positive
Tuberculosis Negative
ðŸš€ Features
Lightweight and efficient architecture using MobileNetV2.
High accuracy in detecting TB from chest X-ray images.
Customizable training pipeline for further fine-tuning.
Data augmentation for improved generalization.
Detailed metrics: confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.
